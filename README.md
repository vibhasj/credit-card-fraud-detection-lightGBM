Credit Card Fraud Detection with LightGBM
Overview

This project builds a production-style machine learning pipeline to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using LightGBM, with a strong focus on class imbalance, business-driven evaluation, and model interpretability.

The goal is not just high accuracy, but practical fraud detection performance.
